 * *Orders*: a list of customer orders on the website

 You must provide your answer in a *well-documented Jupyter Notebook*. Please provide both comments and graphics with you answers when you find it relevant. Keep in mind that **results and conclusions** must be comprehensible by non-technical employees. 

 You may use any package you find necessary to complete the following.

 Please provide a step-by-step analysis and answer the following questions.

 **Orders and products :**
 1. How many items are there in customer orders ? What is the average basket ?
